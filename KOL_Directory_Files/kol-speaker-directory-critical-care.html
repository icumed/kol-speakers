<h4 class="borderBottom">A Synopsis of Eric's Message(s):</h4>
              <blockquote>
                <p><strong>&quot;SvO2/ScVO2: A Vital Piece of the Hemodynamic Puzzle; It's Not Just for Sepsis&quot;</strong> <br />
                </p>
                <p>Until the development of S(c)VO2 technology, there was not a simple means of measuring oxygen consumption in the critically ill patient.  SpO2 offered only one half of the puzzle by giving a continuous reading of percentage of hemoglobin saturation in the artery.  Central Venous Oximetry now allows us to get an overall picture of continuous oxygen delivery and tissue perfusion/oxygen consumption.  This allows the bedside nurse to detect subtle changes in the needs of the ICU patient from decreased cardiac output to decreasing hemoglobin without having to rely on subjective findings or timely laboratory tests.  Though ideal for severe sepsis patients, S(c)VO2 should also be utilized in any patient who develops shock (or potential to develop shock) such as trauma, GI bleed, MI, etc.  This lecture will explore these concepts and give the bedside nurse new tools in managing their critical care patients through a simple technology.</p>
                <p><strong>&quot;Are You Unknowingly Harming Patients Through Exposure to Latex?&quot; </strong></p>
                <p>This lecture covers an introduction to latex allergies and how a patient is at risk each time they enter a hospital from hundreds of different sources.  The complexity of the reactions and how to help prevent exposure is covered.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p><strong>&quot;The Science Behind the New Sepsis Bundles&quot;</strong></p>
                <p>Sepsis continues to be the leading cause of non-cardiac deaths in the ICU. Early recognition of SIRS and Sepsis is the key to improving patient outcomes.  In this session we will review the new Surviving Sepsis Guidelines as well as the science and data behind these changes. We have a very small window to initiate the Surviving Sepsis Resuscitation Bundles, therefore Time is Tissue.</p>
